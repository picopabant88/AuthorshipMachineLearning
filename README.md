Project: Authorship Classification in Academic and Scientific Documents: A Machine Learning-Based Approach

   This research introduces a machine learning system that uses text mining to examine and categorize the writing patterns found in scientific reports authored by faculty at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Esmeraldas. The system's goal is to improve academic honesty by detecting potential instances of false authorship. A collection of research papers written in Spanish by faculty members was analyzed using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Word Embeddings to extract key features. Seven different classification methods were tested: Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), RBF Kernel SVC, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Naïve Bayes. The findings showed that Logistic Regression achieved the best accuracy (89.62%), followed by Linear SVC (87.36%) and RBF SVC (86.59%), significantly outperforming classification methods based on trees and probabilities (p < 0.05). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that there were no significant differences in performance among these top three models, suggesting they are all reliable for identifying authorship. These results support the creation of writing style verification systems within academic institutions, which could be integrated with existing plagiarism detection tools.
